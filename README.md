# CV Project

A CV application project using the react framework.

## Overview

A CV is a detailed document which summarizes a person's professional and academic history. This type of information may include work experience, academic achievments, or other types of work. A CV is one of the most important criteria when looking for a job. This application generates a simple CV with proper information provided.

## How It Works

The application opens a form which takes in the user's personal information, education, and work experience.

Personal Information:
- name
- email
- phone number

Education Information:
- school name
- title of study
- date of graduation

Work experience:
- company name
- position title
- main tasks
- date started
- date ended

Once the user clicks submit, a formatted document is generated with all information provided. This document is printer friendly and may be printed to make a physical copy.

The user may also click the edit button to edit the document. All previous information provided will be displayed on the form page again.

## Things to work on

- Add an input which takes the user's address
- Add a feature which allows the user to add multiple schools and/or work experience
- Add a feature which allows the user to provide an introduction
